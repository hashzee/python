    "================================================================\n",
    "Question No. 1\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "-------\n",
    "As its name implplies, Object Oriented Programming is a programming style that is based on objects.\n",
    "All the entities in this programming model are treated as objects. We define objects with their properties and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question No. 2\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "-------\n",
    "1) OOP offers great reusability \n",
    "2) It is quite extendable through inheritence \n",
    "3) Easier to maintain\n",
    "4) It supports agile development\n",
    "5) \n",
    "\n",
    "Question No. 3\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "-------\n",
    "Methods are special functions defined for an object inside its class.\n",
    "Methods are called through object association while function are called by its name. In simple words if a function is \n",
    "defined inside a class (Object's class) it will be called a Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question No. 4\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "Define the following terms:\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "-------\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "In OOP - a Class can be defined as a BLUEPRINT to create objects. It defines what an object will be composed of and how\n",
    "that object will behave. For example, CAR can be a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object: \n",
    "In OOP,an Object is an implementation of a class - in other words, its an instance of a class. For example, in the \n",
    "definition of Class above, we say, CAR is a class. Now, think of Toyota Vitz, this is an Object of Class CAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute: \n",
    "Each object has some fact or information about it. In OOP paradigm, attributes are structured in a class. Take the \n",
    "example of class CAR, the type of car (hatchback, sedan, suv), its color, engine capacity etc are good examples of its \n",
    "attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "Its like what the instance of a class (an object) will do or perform or act based on a given instruction. For example, \n",
    "if we have a class of Mammal, we can make 2 objects Cat and Dog. Both can have a method 'Speak' however based on the \n",
    "message passed / or internal state change, the method will result in Meow or Bark. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5:\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "Write a code in python in which create a class named it Car which\n",
    "have 5 attributes such like (model, color and name etc.) and 3\n",
    "methods. And create 5 object instance from that class.\n",
